* Exclude/Include spaces in their character count
* Set a character limit
* Receive a warning message if their text exceeds their character limit
* See the approximate reading time of their text
* Analyze the letter density of their text
* Select their color theme
* View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
* See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
